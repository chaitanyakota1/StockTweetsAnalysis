RA Project- Stock Tweets Extraction and Analysis

This work is done as an very early stage project to study how informative social media is for predicting prices, and in particular, trading prices. 
I scraped several years of historical messages from the website Stocktwits (https://stocktwits.com/)using various cryptocurrency and stock hashtags and did a deep dive analysis into the platforms tweeting activities and userbase.

Processed billions of tweets and performed EDA to understand the tweeting patterns and visualised the Network graphs to see stock tweeting patters observed for major stocks.

Performed LDA topic modeling on the text to create some pricing factors, and then relate these pricing factors to future movements in cryptocurrency prices.
